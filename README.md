🪙 **MCP Servers To Turn Data to Gold.**

Fast data processing is one of the best use cases of MCP.

If you’re a data wrangler, most of your time is wasted moving data around, cleaning it, and getting it into a format that makes sense.

MCP servers can now help you tap into your data sources and LLMs to analyse massive amounts of data within the shortest time possible.

Whether you’re dealing with messy CSV files, complex APIs, or data scattered across multiple platforms, **_these servers eliminate the manual work that kills your productivity._**

I have been working on several projects for some time, as a personal hobby, where I initially focused on AI Autonomy in Cybersecurity, using MCP servers, from [Bright Data MCP server](https://github.com/brightdata/brightdata-mcp) among others, which have later led to several other personal projects, and discovered the immediate potential for data wranglers who use MCP.

I’ve tested dozens of MCP servers over the past few months.

Most revolve around coding and data, but here’s the reality: many are either too basic for real-world scenarios or too complicated to implement quickly.

What you need are servers that work out of the box and handle the data challenges you face.

This list contains the 13 MCP servers that are suitable for a wide range of data processing tasks.

🌐 **Web Data Collection MCPs**
